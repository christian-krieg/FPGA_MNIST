This is a university project at TU Vienna to create a neural network hardware accelerator with an FPGA.
The network is designed and trained using _Pytorch_ and _Keras_ in Python. 
Using _Xilinx Vivado_ the Neural Network is implemented on _Digilent Zedboard_ featuring a Zynq-7000 ARM/FPGA SoC.
For easy using of the webapp a the FPGA can be controlled via a Webinterface based on Python Flask.

Project Structure
----------------

`net`: Here is everything stored that is relevant for training and designing the network. Pretrained netork parameters are available for _torch_, _keras_ and in _numpy_ format.

`vivado`: 
This is the main project folder where the VHDL implementaiton of the neural network is stored. Additionally the linux driver software source files are stored in `vivado/Software`. For compiling and running the testbenches **ghdl 0.3.7**  and **Vivado 2017.4** have been used. Additional python is needed to generate some of the source files or to run some
testbenches.

`python`:
This folder contains support software to verify the network. All basic network operations like 2d convolutions and poolingis reprogrammed. This is not necessary but helped to understand the internal functioning of the opaque interfaces of _keras_ and _pytorch_.

`webapp`:
Here the Web app control software is stored. It is based on _Flask_ and the _LTEAdmin_. Here images can be upladed
the netork evaluates it and sends back the result.

`tex`:
Contains the documentation of the project in Latex format. A precompiled PDF is available.

`data`:
Contains project data, e.g. the _MNIST_ dataset.

Build
-----

### Requirements

- Vivado 2017.4, for creating the FPGA implemenation
- Python, >3.6 + packages in `python/requirements.txt`
- C11 compiler for the Python Swig Extension
- GHDL: For VHDL testbench simulation checking

### Python Support Package with SWIG Extension

To accelerate certain neural network functions (conv2d, pool, etc.) those are reprogrammed in C and wrapped via SWIG. 
See `python/README.md` for more details on this topic.

### Vivado Project

Open Vivado and select: `Execute Tcl Script`. Navigate to `vivado/project`. If problems occur use the cleanup script
in the folder (either `cleanup.sh` for Linux/Unix or `cleanup.cmd` for Windows). The bitstream can then be generated in
Vivado as usual.

### Linux Kernel Driver

First the python wrapper must be created using swig. Make sure `SWIG >4.0` is installed and run the commands inside a 
terminal:

````shell script
cd projeckt/Software/eggnet
swig -python eggnet.i
````

This should create two files, `eggnet_wrap.c` and `EggnetDriverCore.py`. The first one must then be build togehter 
with the rest of the project using the Vivado SDK or CMake.
