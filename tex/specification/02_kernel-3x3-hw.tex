\subsection{kernel-3x3}

This modules performs the convolution of a single kernel with a single input image patch. This is a multiplication of - in our case - 9 values of length BIT\_WIDTH\_IN with their respective weights which are defined in an array that can be set with a generic. The multiplication results are then added up in an adder tree. The weights are specified in a single generic constant array in row-major notation.

\subsubsection{Interface}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Input interface, a vector of 9 values of length BIT\_WIDTH\_IN.
	\item Output interface, same as conv\_channel.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Parameter}
\begin{itemize}
	\item BIT\_WIDTH\_IN: integer
	\item BIT\_WIDTH\_OUT: integer
	\item WEIGHT: array of 9 integers
	\item WEIGHT\_WIDTH: integer
\end{itemize}
